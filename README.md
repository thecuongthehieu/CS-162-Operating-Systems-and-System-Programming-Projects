# CS162-Operating-Systems-and-Systems-Programming
## Course Info
- The purpose of this course is to teach the design of operating systems and operating systems concepts that appear in other advanced systems. Topics we will cover include concepts of operating systems, systems programming, networked and distributed systems, and storage systems, including multiple-program systems (processes, interprocess communication, and synchronization), memory allocation (segmentation, paging), resource allocation and scheduling, file systems, basic networking (sockets, layering, APIs, reliability), transactions, security, and privacy.

- We will be using the Pintos educational operating system for all three projects.

- Homeworks (individual assignments) and projects (group assignments) will all be submitted and autograded via GitHub.

- Project teams can be 3 or 4 people, but we recommend you form groups of 4.

- We are using the relatively new text book, “Operating Systems: Principles and Practice” by Anderson and Dahlin.

## Prerequisites
- CS 61A, CS 61B, CS 61C, and CS 70. This means, in particular, that you know C, Java, and data structures (at the level covered in CS 61A/61B), have done some assembly language programming, and that you know about series and products, logarithms, advanced algebra, some calculus, and basic probability (means, standard deviations, etc.). The TAs will spend a small amount of time reviewing some of the material you are less likely to remember. We will assume that you either know the material that is supposed to be covered in those courses, or that you are willing to learn the material as necessary. We will not spend time in lecture covering any of this material.

## Tutorial
  - git pull staff master
  - touch test_file
  - git add test_file
  - git commit -m "Added a test file."
  - git push personal master
